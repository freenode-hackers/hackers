  "body": "# Welcome to our community at freenode ##hackers.\r\n\r\n_TL;DR - we try to be nice and we're the opposite of a \"RTFM\" channel/community._\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide a \"newbie-friendly\" atmosphere,for all people interested in hacking and IT. \r\nThere are many \"hacker\" and \"security professional\" communities on the internet, our goal with ##hackers is not to displace any of them but to provide what's missing -- an informal community for people who wish to learn any and all things IT and security related, where we welcome asking all questions(even if they don't sound very smart),encourage a friendly atmosphere for beginners as well as for those who don't necessarily work with IT security but have to interact with the security community. \r\n\r\nOver the years we've seen too many people with good potential to succeed in IT as well as in security giving up on their pursuit as a result of many false perceptions regarding the IT and security community as well as lack of resources,help and encouragement in their pursuit. At ##hackers , we aim to change that. \r\n\r\n# Channel Rules\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Be polite: incivility or disrespect towards others will not be tolerated  (really,this means you! no exceptions)\r\n\r\n2. Ask anything(use good judgement),don't demand an answer.\r\n\r\n3. Don't ask us to hack anyone or anything for you: not for free; not for money; not for services\r\n\r\n4. Abide by the rules of Freenode: https://freenode.net/policies\r\n\r\n5. We believe in a free exchange of ideas: if you don't know then ask\r\n\r\n6. Hackers is a technical channel not a social channel,socializing is encouraged but you must \r\n   tone-down off-topic discussion when any technical matter is brought up.\r\n\r\n7. Off-topic is allowed as long as you're following the channel rules.\r\n\r\n8. Do *NOT* feed trolls, troll feeders are trolls themselves, ops are an exemption since they are the ones who have to kick/ban them.\r\n\r\n9. Do not under any circumstance insult or attack someone for a question they asked regardless how silly it maybe\r\n\r\n10. NO soliciting for commercial/for-profit purpose\r\n\r\n11. If a person asks a question you don't like then don't answer with a passive-aggressive question or answer.you have the right to ignore them!! you might meet someone smarter or dumber than you,treat everyone with respect.If you don't have something nice to say,then be quiet(this is a great life advice btw!!)\r\ndon't feed trolls,inform the ops or talk to the person in PM. one person's behavior can adversely affect the atmosphere for the whole channel. please help us keep up a good atmosphere!\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Rule #8 does not apply to off topic discussion,it applies to technical topics only.\r\n\r\n13. List of topics not allowed under any circumstance:\r\n\r\n      Politics\r\n\r\n      Personal sexual(ity-ish?) \r\n\r\n      Porn(any kind)/NSFW\r\n\r\nhackers is a moderated channel, the list above means we are neither prepared nor willing to moderate\r\nthese topics, it is either the blacklist above or a complete ban on off-topic discussion -  we have chosen the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Don't forget,you were once a noob too (##hackers is a no 'RTFM' channel) ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ops/Contact info\r\nPlease contact the following users on freenode for any problems or concerns or email us at freenode.hackers@protonmail.com .\r\n\r\n\r\n* jabberwock\r\n* Absolute0x0\r\n* Trazi\r\n* wilsonfisk\r\n* honey\r\n* ethicalhacker\r\n* Captain_Beezay\r\n\r\n# Useful and educational links:\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated with any links that are educational or useful.",
